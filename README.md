# Welcome to CPU Gregorian Chant!

CPU Gregorian Chant is a web application that procedurally generates Gregorian Chant. It generates music in all eight Gregorian modes and provides theoretical information so users can hear and read about the differences in Gregorian modes. The application includes articles on notation, modes and history as well as a bibliography.
